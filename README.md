# Encoded strings and uwsgi magic variables

URL encoded strings (AKA [URL Quoting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#url-quoting) in python) don't well play inside configuration files (*.ini files).  
The issues lies in strings containing sequences chars matching to chars in the [magic table of configuration placeholders](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration.html#magic-variables).  
It leads to issues like urlencoded strings (i.g.: passwords) being modified by uwsgi process.
Real (and common usage) exemple:  
Given a environmwent varible like `DSN=amqp://admin:ABC_%3F@localhost:5972` and placed at `uwsgi.ini`, when I run the application it's expected to 
get (i.g.: `os.environ['DSN']`) the string `amqp://admin:ABC_%3F@localhost:5972`.   
However, the returned string is something like this: `amqp://admin:ABC_tmpF@localhost:5972`  
Because `%3` (from string `ABC_%3F`) is a reserved placeholder (see magic vars), it  corresponds to a specific component of the full path of the directory containing the config file - in my case, `tmp/` dir.
